    "One of the most important mantras of software development is \"don’t repeat yourself.\"  \n",
    "That is, any time you are faced with a problem of creating highly repetitive code (or cutting and pasting source code), it often pays to look for a more elegant solution.  \n",
    "In Python, such problems are often solved under the category of \"metaprogramming.\"  \n",
    "In a nutshell, metaprogramming is about creating functions and classes whose main goal is to manipulate code by modifying, generating, or wrapping existing code.  \n",
    "The main features for this include decorators, class decorators, and metaclasses.  \n",
    "However, a variety of other useful topics -- including signature objects, execution of code with exec(), and inspecting the internals of functions and classes -- enter the picture.  \n",
    "The main purpose of this chapter is to explore various metaprogramming techniques and to give examples of how they can be used to customize the behavior of Python to your own whims."

    "The code inside a decorator typically involves creating a new function that accepts any arguments using `*args` and `**kwargs`, as shown with the `wrapper()` function in this recipe.  \n",

    "The return value of a decorator is almost always the result of calling `func(*args, **kwargs)`, where `func` is the original unwrapped function.  \n",

    "However, if you are going to write decorators for real, there are some subtle details to consider.  \n",
