    "Attribute names listed in the `__slots__` specifier are internally mapped to specific indices within this array.  \n",

    "The memory saved by using `__slots__` varies according to the number and type of attributes stored.  \n",
    "However, in general, the resulting memory use is comparable to that of storing data in a tuple.  \n",
    "To give you an idea, storing a single `Date` instance without slots requires 428 bytes of memory on a 64-bit version of Python.  \n",
    "If slots is defined, it drops to 156 bytes.  \n",
    "In a program that manipulated a large number of dates all at once, this would make a significant reduction in overall memory use.  \n",
    "Although slots may seem like a feature that could be generally useful, you should resist the urge to use it in most code.  \n",
    "There are many parts of Python that rely on the normal dictionary-based implementation.  \n",
    "In addition, classes that define slots don’t support certain features such as multiple inheritance.  \n",
    "For the most part, you should only use slots on classes that are going to serve as frequently used data structures in your program (like if your program created millions of instances of a particular class).  \n",
    "A common misperception of `__slots__` is that it is an encapsulation tool that prevents users from adding new attributes to instances.  \n",
    "Although this is a side effect of using slots, this was never the original purpose.  \n",
    "Instead, `__slots__` was always [intended to be an optimization tool](http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/inside-story-on-new-style-classes.html)."
