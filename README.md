## My Python 3 Cookbook  

This repo contains interesting recipes, code snippets, exercises, and other useful (and not-so-useful) Python 3 programs.  

I'll do my best to make sure that all of my cribbed and copied material is properly attributed, but if you poach anything from this site, find the original source or just don't make any money off of it.
