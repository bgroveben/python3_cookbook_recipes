# In the following sections, we will explore some more advanced pytest
# features.
# To do this, we will need a small project to work with.
# We will be writing a wallet application that enables its users to add or
# spend money in the wallet.
# It will be modeled as a class with two instance methods: spend_cash and
# add_cash.
